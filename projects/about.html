                <p>I'm a mechanical engineer with a strong interest in aerospace, robotics, energy, and embedded systemsâ€”especially when they come together in hands-on, multidisciplinary projects.
                
                I created this site to share my projects and experiments in engineering design, coding, and hands-on fabrication. I studied Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, where I've been involved with the IGNITORS rocketry team, the SAE Aero Design team, and a variety of robotics projects.
                
                Before that, I got into tinkering, spending time outdoors, and figuring out how to do more with less. Outside of engineering, I like tennis, basketball, chess, and coffee. Recently, I've been learning how to use machine learning for things like structural analysis and design optimization, and just seeing where those tools can be useful in engineering problems.
