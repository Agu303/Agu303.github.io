            <h2>SAE Aero Design</h2>
            <p>I spent the entirety of my sophomore, the '22-'23 season, working on structurally optimized plane for the Society of Automotive Engineers Aero Design competition.  This competition gives teams annually-updated design constraints and rules to build structurally optimized planes to carry metal payload.  The plane had to be structurally optimized to be as light as possible while carrying as much payload weight as possible.  I mostly worked on the payload design and implemented manufacturing methods for fuselage, control surfaces, and the wings.  My team took first place in the international competition, and details about our design can be found on A&M's newsletter and team website. </p>
