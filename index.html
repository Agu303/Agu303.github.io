            <h2>Rocketry</h2>
            <p> I've become very interested in rocketry since my freshman year.  Since then I have worked on contructing rockets and analysis tools to for competition and L-certification launches.</p>

            <h2>SAE Aero Design</h2>
            <p>I spent the entirety of my sophomore year working on structurally optimizing a plane for the Society of Automotive Engineers Aero Design competition.  This competition gives teams annually-updated design constraints and rules to build planes to carry payload.  The aircraft's structural framework was designed through topological optimization to minimize its own weight while maximizing the payload capacity it can support.  I mostly worked on the payload design and created manufacturing tools for fuselage, control surfaces, and the wing assembly.  My team took first place in the international competition, and details about our design can be found on A&M's newsletter and team website. </p>

            <p>Modular robotic system capable of performing fertilizing and watering informed by sensor data collection and analysis.  This robot was designed to tread a long a 50-foot garden row with the goal of reducing physical strain associated with gardening maintenace through remote control.</p>

            <h2>openLayup</h2>
            <p>openLayup is an open-source, GUI-based structural simulation tool for aerospace structures. The software estimates key mechanical metrics such as stress, strain, and factor of safety based on material properties, ply layup configurations, and component geometries. It applies Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) and the Tsai-Wu failure criterion, enabling laminate-level failure-mode analysis across various aerospace components.</p>
